# Anti-Cheat-list (THIS IS A VERY BIASED LIST, DO NOT TAKE SERIOUSLY, DO NOT COMPARE ANTICHEATS BASED ON THIS LIST. THIS IS A MEME!!!!)
1. Spark - Banned me for autoclicker and 3-3.1 reach on Vape v3 in one duel. 
2. Meow - Basically the best anticheat, for only 50000$ per hour.
3. AGC - Second best private server anticheat, only bested by Spark.
4. Trojan - eh heard it was good but never tried.
5. Overflow/Sparky - good detections on both.
6. Verus (more $$$ versions) - decent overall but too many disablers. If you use Verus your players are either legit or are using TP-aura, fly, and 1000% speed.
7. Karhu - Best budget anticheat IMO, reach detection too good to be just 15 euros.
8. Vulcan - Second best budget anticheat, rapes LiquidBounce and most clients.
9. Frequency - Really good open source anticheat.
10. Medusa/ThotPatrol - Good free options for 1.8 anticheats.
11. Spartan - Bad anticheat IMO, but I needed something to put here.
12. Iris - Before Karhu/Vulcan, this was the budget anticheat of choice for 1.8.
