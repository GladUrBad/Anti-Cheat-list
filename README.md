# Anti-Cheat-list
0. Larry AI anticheat on top. 

1.AGC/Spark - AGC wins this in terms of detections (aim/clicker checks) but spark detects and bans faster than AGC
2.Aque - Was one of the best Anti-Cheats Back In the Days, Rip AQUE-MACHINE-LEARNING-ANTI-CHEAT.
3.Meow - heard it's pretty good but hasn't been tested on public servers
4.Trojan - Made by the best Developer to exist.  Fastest AUTOCLICKER detections ever. 
5.PvPLand's anticheat - pretty good anticheat but has 1-3 bypasses and no clicker checks
6.Verus - stable anticheat for almost any server but has some bypasses
7.DotLegit - Good but rowin bypassed it in 3 mins 
8.Iris - idk ok quality drops after Verus
9.Sparky - haven't heard much for it but can apparently detect some cheats ??
10.Kauri - pretty bad lets be honest but doesnt kill the tps
11.Overflow - has false flags and kills tps on any server
