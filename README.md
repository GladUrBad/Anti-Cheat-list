# Anti-Cheat-list
0. Larry AI anticheat on top. 

1. AGC/Spark - AGC wins this in terms of detections (aim/clicker checks) but spark detects and bans faster than AGC
2. Meow - heard it's pretty good but hasn't been tested on public servers
3. PvPLand's anticheat - pretty good anticheat but has 1-3 bypasses and no clicker checks
4. Verus - stable anticheat for almost any server but has some bypasses
5. Iris - idk ok quality drops after Verus
6. Sparky - haven't heard much for it but can apparently detect some cheats ??
7. Kauri - pretty bad lets be honest but doesnt kill the tps
8. Overflow - has false flags and kills tps on any server
